    <h2><a name="ground">Ground Burial</a></h2>
  <p>Bellevue Memorial Park has many sections, both old and new, to choose from for traditional ground burials. Traditional ground burials are what most often come to mind when thinking of a cemetery.</p>
  <p>The newest sections which have recently become available are located at the west end of our parkâ€“ the new Sunset Courtyard, and adjacent to it, the new Redwood section,which opened in early 2008. Traditional ground burial plots and lawn estates are affordably priced.</p>
  <p>Bellevue Memorial Park offers memorial markers which are a lasting and visible tribute to your loved ones. You can customize the marker you select to capture the true essence and character of your loved ones by choosing from the variety of colors and designs available.</p>
  <p>Burial vaults in the following materials of concrete, plastic, or metal, are designed to protect the casket inside of it from the weight of the ground above, from water intrusion, and from other elements. Unlike a burial liner, which covers the top and sides of the casket, a vault completely encloses the casket.</p>

		Today more families than ever are recognizing the benefits of pre-planning&hellip;</h4>
	<br />
	&quot;It gave us the opportunity to put all our affairs in order in a relaxed way, not when emotionally exhausted. We spent less&hellip;we didn&#39;t overspend.&quot;<br />
	&quot;This decision makes me feel good&hellip;I&#39;m looking out for my wife because I love her. She&#39;ll need the life insurance money to readjust and continue living.&quot;
	<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		&hellip;&quot;I appreciate the variety of financial plans presented to us.&quot;</p>
	<p>
		&quot;We recorded our wishes in the pre-planning guide provided by Bellevue&hellip;Sure, it&#39;s a sensitive subject, but it allowed us to share and express our feelings and personal preferences we needed to discuss.&quot;</p>
	<p>
		By planning ahead now, you will guarantee yourself peace of mind because you will have made all the necessary decisions, and put your affairs in order today.</p>
	<p>
		Planning ahead is protection &ndash; protection that your loved ones will not have to make difficult decisions alone, and that they will not be burdened financially.</p>
	<p>
		Pre-planning eliminates emotional over spending. Pre-planning means savings because arrangements made today will cost much less than they will in the future.</p>
	<p>
		Bellevue Memorial Park Family Service Counselors will walk you through the many options available when you purchase in advance. With the costs of services rising every year, you will be saving considerably by choosing to pre-plan today. Payment plans are available giving you the flexibility to design a package which will work within your family&#39;s budget. We are sure you will find our prices both reasonable and competitive. We invite you to visit our offices and learn more about how you can prepare for tomorrow by planning today.</p>
