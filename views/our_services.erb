    <h2><a name="ground">Ground Burial</a></h2>
  <p>Bellevue Memorial Park has many sections, both old and new, to choose from for traditional ground burials. Traditional ground burials are what most often come to mind when thinking of a cemetery.</p>
  <p>The newest sections which have recently become available are located at the west end of our parkâ€“ the new Sunset Courtyard, and adjacent to it, the new Redwood section,which opened in early 2008. Traditional ground burial plots and lawn estates are affordably priced.</p>
  <p>Bellevue Memorial Park offers memorial markers which are a lasting and visible tribute to your loved ones. You can customize the marker you select to capture the true essence and character of your loved ones by choosing from the variety of colors and designs available.</p>
  <p>Burial vaults in the following materials of concrete, plastic, or metal, are designed to protect the casket inside of it from the weight of the ground above, from water intrusion, and from other elements. Unlike a burial liner, which covers the top and sides of the casket, a vault completely encloses the casket.</p>
