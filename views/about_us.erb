<h2>History</h2>
<img src="/web_images/history.jpg" alt="" align="left" class="body_img">
<p>The Early Years - Bellevue Memorial Park, (Ontario Cemetery Association), was founded in 1891 and incorporated in 1892, with three original shareholders, Charles E. Harwood, H. C. Oakley, and Dr. J.W. Oakley. The senior Mr. Abram Oakley was originally buried in Pomona Cemetery, and his son, Dr. J.W. Oakley later decided he would like him to be buried in Ontario, but there was no cemetery.</p>

<p>The townspeople set aside 10 acres of land at the northwest corner of Mountain Avenue and G Street, then owned by C.E. Harwood. After disinterring Mr. Oakley from Pomona Cemetery, he was interred at Bellevue, and was the city's first official funeral. The name "Bellevue" was selected by Mrs. Oakley, who named the cemetery after a street in her home town of Ontario, Canada. The original by-laws of the Bellevue Cemetery Association are dated May 24, 1891.</p>

The original by-laws of the Bellevue Cemetery Association are dated May 24, 1891.</p>
  <p>Many of the families who helped to shape Ontario's original "Model Colony," and who are largely responsible for what is Ontario today are laid to rest at Bellevue Memorial Park –a few being the Chaffeys, the Millikens, the Atwoods, and the Drapers. The markers and headstones of many Civil War veterans can also be found in the old section of the cemetery. Over 800 veterans are buried at Bellevue Memorial Park from the Civil War, Spanish-American War, the two World Wars, Korea, Viet Nam, and the Iraq War.</p>
  <p>Today - Since 1891, the cemetery has grown considerably, and today encompasses approximately 78 acres. The original Bellevue Mausoleum was constructed in 1915 and contained 300 crypts. In the following years, it was expanded to it's current size of 22,000. The newest Mausoleum, Sunset Mausoleum, was completed in 2005, and houses approximately 900 crypts and 800 niches.</p>
    <p>Bellevue Memorial Park has become an integral part of the community throughout the years, and continues its growth and expansion, serving Ontario and the surrounding communities of the Inland Empire. Bellevue Memorial Park still remains the only cemetery in Ontario and this year celebrates 116 years of service, dedication, and compassion for our many families and their loved ones.</p>
